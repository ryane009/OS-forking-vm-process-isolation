## Part 1

**Remarks (optional):** The interface of WP took a little getting used to, but in the end I started to catch
on more. You can definitely see how it's a precursor to text-word editors.

## Part 2

### Q1 (Atari game)

I played air raid, and it was pretty fun. It's always fun to try out the old archade style games
that you hear about in stories, and the controls were surpusingly intuitive. Granted though I
may have missed some game features, as a game menu wasn't exactly clear. However extracting it from
Stella was pretty intuitive and straightforward.

### Q2 (HW emulator assumptions)

When new arhcitectures are developed, it'll become harder and harder to create and preserve hardware 
emulators. While they are a much better alternative to accessing old archives than maintaining the 
physcial retro hardware itself, new processing systems with new bells and whistles would require
developers to once again make new emulators that are compatible with the new architectures, but in
the long run this may become infeasible. 

## Part 3

### Q3 (Comparing with other forms of preservation)

<!-- Answer here -->
Art/architecture: Involves physcial restoration to try to replicate or enance the original intent/details of the work. This may require modifications, which may change the original intent or vision of the project.

Historical events: While it is impossible to replicate events, there are ways to preserve intangible via media such as recordings, film, books, or text.

Books/media: Some old books and media are preserved as is to retain the sigtnificance of its message (eg artifacts from the Holocaust)

Digital media encompasses all these different ideas. As it is virtually impossible to retrieve the origins of a lot of hardware/software and it is equally as difficult to reverse/engineer/locate the origins and source code of a lot of software, a lot of software is lost and it is difficult to replicate/maintain old technologies. In addition, while innovative and influential to modern computing, the retro hardware that are used by these precursor programs/software are often outdated, and virtually impossible/infeasible to maintain in the long run. However, like the other forms of preservation for objects/items/parts of culture considered significant, the remanants that still exist are preserved under the library of Congress, or through self-means of preservation. For instance, the creators of various softwares have left their mark through the use of easter eggs, of which now persists as a common practice in the development of new software. It mirrors the imprints the legacy that artists and architects leave via their distinctive styles. Furthermore, software can be preserved through rememberance, or even restored via reverse engineering techniques to try to emulate the original source code. 

A big difference with software however is that it is not tangible. Since its a lot harder to observe and qualify the  abstract and non-observable nature of software, there are many questions about its importance, what it offers, and what it even is. 


### Q4 (Legal protections and obligation to pay)

* Individual response: Argument (some forms of software should not be preserved or receive protections)
- A lot of the source code created in these softwares were never intended to be made public, and releasing the works of original software engineers in public archives can remove the ownership that they have over their creations and
source codes
- It can also lead to the unintended distribution of company archival secrets, which further breaches privacy rights
- In addition, to replicate or maintain old technologies that are not compatible with modern technology are expensive,
and do not serve much of a purpose beyond historical rememberance. 

* Discussion with partner: 
Andrew: The importance of its cutlural significance and impact on modern computing make it inavaluable, to the extent where it outweighs the costs
- Alot of early software served as precursors to modern software principles and technologies, and it deserves to be remembered as revolutionary innovations
- Every piece of software is an expression of a Software engineer's craft and personal touch (as seen by easter eggs and the meticulous process that was used to develop these works), and the scrapping of their works and creations is a direct violation of their creative rights and intention.
- As there are large efforts to preserve film and pioneering media technologies/works/arts, shouldn't the same principles be applied to original software as it is inherently a form of expression, art, and cultural touchstones

My argument:
- A lot of the source code created in these softwares were never intended to be made public, and releasing the works of original software engineers in public archives can remove the ownership that they have over their creations and
source codes
- It can also lead to the unintended distribution of company archival secrets, which further breaches privacy rights
- In addition, to replicate or maintain old technologies that are not compatible with modern technology are expensive,
and do not serve much of a purpose beyond historical rememberance. 

Common ground: 
- While privacy and the maintenance of ownership are valid concerns, the cultural and personal importance of these ideas in shaping culture and modern principles outweighs all the costs and concerns. In adition, as software is created with a precision, intention, and personalized craft likeable to other arts that are preserved, software should be too for cultural enrichment. 
- We came to the agreement that software should be viewed in the same lens of arts, and thus should hold the same cultural significance and as so, receive the same protections. 
- However the security risks and ownership/privacy concerns of sensnsitive source code within the software should be acknolwedged, and handled accordingly through the careful rollout of non-sensitive information only, and gradual rollback of redactions as privacy concerns become less of an issue over time. For instance, as source code develops further into the realm of relics, it most likely becomes less of a security risk and soruce of privacy. While this requires more work, it is vital that old archives are properly cleared before being released to the public in order to
prevent exploitation. 
- The government and interested parties should play their part of preserving these technologies for the public good, thus offsetting its costs. The same practice can be seen in arts and architectures with restoration efforts. This may lead to the lost of some software that cannot garner the required interest/funds to preserve it, however this is the unfortunate reality of these case-by-case processes.

### Q5 (Responsibilities of stakeholders)

<!-- Answer here -->
Government Responsibilities: Maintain the official public archives, and develop the policies regarding the preservation of various softwares in accordance to public use/enjoyment and private ownership rights.

Industry: Determine what archived software can become open-source for public use, and work with the government to finance and develop policies on preserving their software for the future.

Non-profit: Raise funds, garner support for software preservation, and educate consumers about the value/importance of software preservation.

### Q6 (Expensive taste vs public good)

* Individual response: Its an expensive taste, but it should be a public good. While a majority of legacy software should ideally become public as they have now become cultural relics, touchstones, and glimpses into the past, as of
now a majority of efforts aimed at preserving this software has been privately funded and based on personal interest. There isn't enough public attention where there are large public camapigns to maintain software, and in addition to this, the author of the digital archive text even acknowledged that the value of preserving software is not yet
realized (its value will most likely be more long term for future generational interest in software), and there has to be more public action traction toward preserving and educating about the value of legacy software. 

* Response to partner: 

- Andrew argued that legacy software is a public good as its value will become more widespread and embedded in society. In the future, as software becomes mroe and more prevalent, Andrew beleives the public will develop an overall consensus regarding its value, and learn to recognize its fundamental impact on shaping modern society and culture. Overall, we both agreed that its current value to indviudals is still niche, but over time, as it is inherently valuable to society and its development over time, more and more indviduals will recognize its value. As a result, it will emerge as a pivotal centerpiece in signifiying cultural and technological growth, just as other architectural and art works have signified cultural and innovative peaks.
