Who was your stakeholder pair? (<1 sentence)
- Pair 5, Matt Bleat, and The Center for Changing Our Campus Culture

What kind of delete did you implement and why? Explain your decisions as if you were reporting to an ethical auditor who will determine whether your design is justified. 
Highlight and explain what you think is the most compelling reason that supports the specific kind of deletion you’ve implemented (1-2 short paragraphs)
- In my project, I opted to provide anonymity to the situation by redacting the user 
request's name from all posts. As our pairing found the evidence to be inconclusive
and Matt Bleat requested the right to be forgotten, to respect his wishes I chose
to take attribution away from the actions he is accused of. However, in weighing the
other stakeholder opinion, I felt that this was a concern of public safety and
indviudals had the right to know the potential risks (the evidence was found to be
inconclusive, thus Bleat isn't neccessarily innocent), therefore I chose to keep the
posts. While Matt does have a right to erasure, the right to know also applies,
and other stakeholders should be allowed to know about a delicate situation like this so they could better protect themselves as a precaution, and make a decision on their
own about the situation rather than being fully censored. 

What are the shortcomings of your implementation? Who are some short term and/or long term stakeholders (beyond the ones we’ve asked you to consider) who could be adversely affected by your decision? (1-2 short paragraphs)
- Against Matt Bleat's wishes, those who decide to look into it and investigate the matter can still, and word of mouth still applies as the posts still exist. While we
removed his name and thus the posts are not attributed to him and cannot be linked to
him via an external search or cursory glance from a user on tweeter, the post still exists, and users are aware that an athlete at Brown was accused of sexual misconduct. Therefore while it removes attribution to Matt Bleat, there is still a digital footprint for those who want to follow it. On the other hand, The Center for
Changing Our Campus Culture may want more transparency on the situation, as the posts 
are no longer attributed to any indviudal when it clearly refers to someone. 

From the other standpoint and stakeholder of BrownU Athletics, they may interpret this in a couple of different ways. As this sensitive matter may concern safety, BrownU has the right to investigate and look into this, and with this information they
may want to pursue further action. Therefore in this case, the knowledge and ability to reference to such archives may be useful in allowing them to pursue their own internal review of their athletes and come to their own consensus/uphold their integrity. However at the same time, if they find the evidence to be inconclsuive, the controversy could be detrimental to their sports program, and may give a poor reflection of their athletics and recuitment program, a price to give for upholding a
general user's right to know. 

How might your approach to this assignment change if you were asked to consider the interests of other stakeholders not mentioned in the scenario? (1-2 short paragraphs)
- Had other stakeholders been involved like Brown University or someone else who may
want to know more or rather see the post removed from the public eye (for defamation or other intents and purposes), I may have changed my approach by removing the post from Tweeter, but keeping it in some sort of public database or archive that indviudals can request to view should they believe that they have the right to know more about the situation. Thus, I would find any posts that had Matt Bleat's name 
mentioned, remove them from tweeter, and put them in an archive that Brown could access for internal review, or general students at Brown who may feel threatened
about the situation, and would want to learn more to protect themselves. This further
preserves Matt's anonymity and removes the entire allegation from Tweeter, yet at the same time the details are preserved for those who have a right to access it.
